## Implementation
### Achievements
This web application allows users to add, monitor and control devices in their smart home. This prototype has six types of smart home devices. All required pages and extensions have been implemented.
In designing basic web pages, the home page can be designed to show all stored devices in one summary dashboard, while adding a device page can give the user permission to customize their device types. 
In working on extensions, front-end styling can be improved if I learn more about tailwindcss. Data sanitization has been implemented on the client-side using a regular expression, but it can be improved if I use the express-validator in the router.
Every page is composed of several components. While some components are used multiple times, the reusable components should be written in a .js file and composed as different web pages. If there is much more time to complete this coursework, I will configure a method to reduce the redundancy.
